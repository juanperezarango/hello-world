My first repository in GitHub
Hello Githubbers!
This is my first repository in GitHub.
My name is Juan and as a Climate Scientist this is a milestone for me since I 
decided to start using GitHub today as a tool to better track my research work in Climate Science
I have been programing for years, but having a repository is something new for me.
